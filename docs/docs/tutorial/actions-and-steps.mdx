# Actions and steps

Whenever you want to change any control property you need to take an action. Actions are grouped in steps.

So the simple step could look like this:

```dabl showLineNumbers
step: 'this is my step title' duration: 2s
box id: myBox size: [2,2]
myBox -> (100,50)
```

Above step has title and takes 2s to run. It consists of one action moving control **myBox** to position 100 50

## Sequential and parallel actions
Every step can have **sequential** and **parallel** actions or both

### sequential actions

To create two sequential actions in one step you need to declare them in new line
e.g below example first moves *myBox* to point (100,0), next *otherControl* is moved by (200,0)

 :::note
absolute move **to** point **(x,y)** and relative move **by** point **+(x,y)**  have same end effect here
 :::

```dabl
step: 'this is my step title'
myBox -> (100,50)
otherControl -> +(200,0)
```
 <dots-and-boxes controls style={{height: 250}}  code="
 box id: myBox at: [-2,0] size: [2,1] color: red
 box id: otherControl at: [-2,-2] size: [2,1] color: black
 step: 'this is my step title'
 myBox -> (100,0)
 otherControl -> +(200,0)">
 </dots-and-boxes>

### parallel actions

Here we we define one step with two actions done in parallel:
*myBox* is moved to (100,0) and *otherControl* is moved by 200 units right at the same time
```dabl
step: 'this is my step title'
myBox -> (100,0), otherControl -> +(200,0)
```
 <dots-and-boxes controls style={{height: 250}}  code="
 box id: myBox at: [-2,0] size: [2,1] color: red
 box id: otherControl at: [-2,-2] size: [2,1] color: black
 step: 'this is my step title'
 myBox -> (100,0), otherControl -> +(200,0)
">
 </dots-and-boxes>
### parallel and sequential actions

Now lets try to mix both in one step.

First *myBox* is moved to (100,0) and otherControl moved by (200,0) at the same time and
finally otherControl and myBox swap positions

```dabl
step: 'this is my step title'
myBox -> (100,0), otherControl -> +(200,0)
otherControl <-> myBox
```

<dots-and-boxes controls style={{height: 250}}  code="
 box id: myBox at: [-2,0] size: [2,1] color: red
 box id: otherControl at: [-2,-2] size: [2,1] color: black
 step: 'this is my step title'
 myBox -> (100,0), otherControl -> +(200,0)
 otherControl <-> myBox
">
 </dots-and-boxes>

# Dots and Boxes

### what and what for?
 **dots and boxes** allows drawing dots and boxes and do simple step based animations making it easy to
visualise some algorithms or your raw ideas e.g. show event flow in a distributed system.

But hey, you can use it for whatever you like!

#### visualise algorithms

Let's assume you want to explain how bubble sort works. Write dots and boxes code like one below:

```dabl tab showLineNumbers
title: sort with bubble sort
box id: win at: [-6, 0] size: [2, 1] color: rgba(254,193,7,0.6) visible: false
dots ids: 2 1 5 3 4 at: [-3,0] size: 20
step: '(1) select first two numbers' duration: 0.8s
win <- visible: true, win -> +[3,0]
step: '(2) swap if left bigger than right'
2 <-> 1 // swap dot 2 with 1
step: '(3) select next two numbers'
win -> +[1,0] // move window by 1 cell right
step: 'ignore if left is smaller and select next'
win -> +[1,0]
step: 'again swap if left bigger'
5 <-> 3
step: 'and again'
win -> +[1,0]
5 <-> 4
step: 'repeat from start'
win -> -[3,0]
```
```html tab showLineNumbers
<dots-and-boxes controls style="height: 300px"  code="
  title: sort with bubble sort
  box id: win at: [-6, 0] size: [2, 1] color: rgba(254,193,7,0.6) visible: false
  dots ids: 2 1 5 3 4 at: [-3,0] size: 20
  step: '(1) select first two numbers' duration: 0.8s
  win <- visible: true, win -> +[3,0]
  step: '(2) swap if left bigger than right'
  2 <-> 1 // swap dot 2 with 1
  step: '(3) select next two numbers'
  win -> +[1,0] // move window by 1 cell right
  step: 'ignore if left is smaller and select next'
  win -> +[1,0]
  step: 'again swap if left bigger'
  5 <-> 3
  step: 'and again'
  win -> +[1,0]
  5 <-> 4
  step: 'repeat from start'
  win -> -[3,0]">
</dots-and-boxes>
```

and see **dots and boxes** visualization result:

 <dots-and-boxes controls style={{height: 300}}    code="
   title: sort with bubble sort
   box id: win at: [-6, 0] size: [2, 1] color: rgba(254,193,7,0.6) visible: false
   dots ids: 2 1 5 3 4 at: [-3,0] size: 20
   step: '(1) select first two numbers' duration: 0.8s
   win <- visible: true, win -> +[3,0]
   step: '(2) swap if left bigger than right'
   2 <-> 1 // swap dot 2 with 1
   step: '(3) select next two numbers'
   win -> +[1,0] // move window by 1 cell right
   step: 'ignore if left is smaller and select next'
   win -> +[1,0]
   step: 'again swap if left bigger'
   5 <-> 3
   step: 'and again'
   win -> +[1,0]
   5 <-> 4
   step: 'repeat from start'
   win -> -[3,0]">
</dots-and-boxes>

Play with control buttons, to see what happens.

## How it works ?

Technically **dots and boxes** is an [HTML5 custom element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Components/Using_custom_elements).
You can add *dots-and-boxes* tag (just like normal *div* tag) to your page with code attribute defining controls and animation steps.  On the next page [getting started] page to see how to use it.

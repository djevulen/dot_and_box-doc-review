# Dots and Boxes

### what is it for?
 **dots and boxes** allows to draw dots and boxes and do simple step based animations making it easier to
explain algorithms or visualise your raw ideas e.g. show event flows in a distributed system.

But hey, you can use it for whatever you like!

#### visualise algorithms

Let's assume you want to explain how bubble sort works. Write dots and boxes lang code:

```C showLineNumbers
title: sort with bubble sort
box id: win at: [-6, 0] size: [2, 1] color: rgba(254,193,7,0.6) visible: false
dots ids: 2 1 5 3 4 at: [-3,0] size: 20
step: '(1) select first two numbers' duration: 0.8s
win <- visible: true, win -> +[3,0]
step: '(2) swap if left bigger than right'
2 <-> 1 // swap dot 2 with 1
step: '(3) select next two numbers'
win -> +[1,0] // move window by 1 cell right
step: 'ignore if left is smaller and select next'
win -> +[1,0]
step: 'again swap if left bigger'
5 <-> 3
step: 'and again'
win -> +[1,0]
5 <-> 4
step: 'repeat from start'
win -> -[3,0]
```

here is how it's turned into **dots and boxes** visualization:

 <dots-and-boxes controls style={{height: 300}}    code="
       title: sort with bubble sort
       box id: win at: [-6, 0] size: [2, 1] color: rgba(254,193,7,0.6) visible: false
       dots ids: 2 1 5 3 4 at: [-3,0] size: 20
       step: '(1) select first two numbers' duration: 0.8s
       win <- visible: true, win -> +[3,0]
       step: '(2) swap if left bigger than right'
       2 <-> 1 // swap dot 2 with 1
       step: '(3) select next two numbers'
       win -> +[1,0] // move window by 1 cell right
       step: 'ignore if left is smaller and select next'
       win -> +[1,0]
       step: 'again swap if left bigger'
       5 <-> 3
       step: 'and again'
       win -> +[1,0]
       5 <-> 4
       step: 'repeat from start'
       win -> -[3,0]">
</dots-and-boxes>

Play with control buttons, to see what happens.

## How it works ?

Technically **dots and boxes** is just an [HTML5 custom element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Components/Using_custom_elements)
you can add to your page with code attribute defining controls and animation steps - got to [getting started] page to see how to use it.

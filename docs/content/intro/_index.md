Project goal is to create a simple language and visualizer to explain algorithms and common CS patterns
or do simple step based animations visualizing your raw ideas. 

Technically Dots and Boxes is an *HTML5 custom element* you can add to your page with code
attribute defining dots and boxes and action (animation) steps.

Project was highly inspired by [mermaid.js](https://mermaid.js.org/), although it has different goals
